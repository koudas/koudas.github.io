<p>
The maturity of several Deep Learning technologies has influenced the design and instigated re-thinking several
design principles of data processing systems and architectures.

The goal of this course is two-fold. First present a review of the fundamental design components of
modern data management architectures including a review of relational and NoSQL systems. Second
review and explore how fundamental components can be re-designed by incorporating Deep Learning principles
and techniques and explore the resulting (performance and system) implications. In particular this term the course will focus on the redesign of popular information retrieval paradigms utilizing
  deep learning and large language models.

    <p> <b>Class Format</b>
    <ul>
    <li><p>This is a seminar course. Each class will consist of presentations and discussion. Students will be required to do 
	    a class project for the course. A significant portion of the grade will be based on class participation, which 
	    includes paper presentations, contributions to paper reviews, and paper discussions. Because of the interactive nature of the course, and space limitations, auditing is discouraged.
    </p></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
	  <p> <b>Prerequisites</b>
	  <ul>
		<li><p>Background in algorithms, databases, machine learning suggested.</p></li>
	  </ul>
	  </p>    
<p><b>Assignments</b>
    <ul>
      <li>A research class project: Each of you will work on a research project and file a single submission. The project will be 
	      broken down to three assignments: (1) initial research proposal, (2) Intermediate report, (3) final report and 
	      presentation</li>
	<li> Proposed class projects will be described by the instructor.
Feel free to discuss your ideas with the instructor and propose your
own project. However the project you propose HAS to be associated with the material in the class.
    <b>This is very important and it is not up for discussion</b>. The project should have a research component. 
Project ideas will be outlined in class but you are responsible for proposing your project. Some background reading
is associated with each project.
The project proposal (due date Oct 23) should contain the following information:
<ul>
  <li>Topic to be addressed and the nature of the problem
  <li>State of the art (prior work, what remains unsolved, etc.)
  <li>The proposed technique to be implemented/evaluated
  <li>To what degree the project will repeat existing work
  <li>Specific, measurable goals: deliverables, and dates you expect to produce them
</ul>
Project proposals should be a two pages at most. A project status report is due on Nov 20. 
		The status report should include a description of progress to date and what is expected to be accomplished by 
		the final project presentation day.</li>
      
	<li>Questions and Responses (QRs): During each class you will need to provide 2 questions in writing for each (mandatory) paper. Questions will be <b>individual assignments</b>. For each class one of you will be responsible to lead a discussion on the papers and provide answers to all questions provided during class. Questions and responses will then be summarized in a written report which will be submitted and shared with everyone in the class. </li>            
      <li>There will be <b> no midterm or final exams</b>.
    </ul>
</p>
	<p><b>Final Project Reports</b>
		<ul>
			<li> Final project reports are due Jan 2 2023 </li>
			<li> Reports should be structured as a research paper, containing an introduction to the problem solved and its importance, 
				summary of related work with citations, a section detailing if the methodology is new and proposed by you or whether it is from the literature, along with citations of any techniques you implemented,
				a description of the technical developments outlining algorithms and their description, detailed experimental evaluation, conclusions and thoughts on future work and extensions.
			<li> Essentially your report should mirror the structure of the papers you have been reading during the term </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
<p><b>Misc</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Class time may be adjusted to accomodate external talks releated to the class.</li>      
    </ul>
